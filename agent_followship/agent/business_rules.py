"""
Core business rule engine for patient follow-up determination.

This module implements the deterministic logic for:
1. Identifying which patients are overdue for follow-up
2. Computing urgency levels based on clinical and operational factors

The rule engine is intentionally deterministic (non-LLM) to provide
transparency and auditability, which is crucial for healthcare applications.

    Deterministic rule engine for identifying overdue patients.

    The separation of deterministic rules from AI-based decision making
