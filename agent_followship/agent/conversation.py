Conversation management and intent recognition for patient interactions.

This module handles multi-turn conversations with patients, understanding
their intent and deciding on appropriate follow-up actions.

class ConversationManager:
    """
    Manages multi-turn conversations with patients.
    
    This is the core "autonomous decision-making" component of the agent.
    It analyzes patient replies, recognizes intent, and determines the
    next action to take - demonstrating the agent's ability to handle
    dynamic, unscripted interactions.
    
    Key capabilities:
    - Intent recognition (booking, declining, rescheduling, questions)
    - Context tracking across conversation turns
    - Escalation detection (when human intervention is needed)
