"""
Agent actions and decision framework.

This module defines the available actions that the agent can take
when processing follow-up cases, representing the "Act" phase of
the agentic loop (Perceive -> Decide -> Act -> Observe).

from enum import Enum


class AgentAction(Enum):
    """
    Enumeration of all possible actions the agent can take.
    
    These actions represent the agent's decision space. Each action
    corresponds to a specific behavior that moves a follow-up case
    forward in the workflow.
    
    Actions:
        SEND_REMINDER: Send initial or follow-up reminder to patient
        PROPOSE_SLOT: Suggest available appointment times to patient
        CONFIRM_BOOKING: Finalize appointment after patient confirms
        RESCHEDULE: Change existing appointment to new time
        ESCALATE_TO_STAFF: Transfer case to human staff for manual handling
        MARK_DECLINED: Record that patient declined or postponed follow-up
        DO_NOTHING: No action needed at this time (e.g., already contacted recently)
